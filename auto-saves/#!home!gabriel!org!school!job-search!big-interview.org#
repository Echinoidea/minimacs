* Big Interview
** Tell me about yourself
- I'm a software developer with two years of experience in full-stack web development, specifically with Next.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL, and I graduate this December. I also love to challenge myself to learn about new programming languages and techniques so I can use them in my work. I'm particularly interested in this position because my experience matches your requirements closely and I would love to contribute my front-end development experience to an innovative SaaS company like this.
  
** What are your greatest strengths?
- I believe one of my greatest strengths is my enthusiasm. I really enjoy what I do, so big feature requests, projects, etc. excite me and I love tackling these big problems. I get to learn about techniques or technology to solve the problem, make my product better, and solve problems which brings me a lot of satisfaction.
** What are your greatest weaknesses?
- Although I love big problems, I still struggle when I have a very large task ahead of me, like creating a new release version with lots of features and bug fixes. I sometimes find myself jumping between tasks, forgetting pieces, or switching to a task before the previous one is complete. To help with this, I use a system of prioritized todo lists and sublists, along with specific requirements for all of them like creating automated tests. This system has helped me a lot with this issue while also helping me make more reliable code.
** Tell me about a time where you had to manage multiple priorities and deadlines.
- During my role as a full stack developer for SMHC, I had to manage two projects with similar deadlines for release. In the coming month before release, I managed my time in two phases: in the first, I divided my time to finalizing the features and bugs for each project equally. In the second phase, I finalized a full internal user test and caught edge cases which I resolved ad hoc. Doing this, I was successfully able to release two projects into production at the same time with no issues.
** What questions do you have?
- Your job posting mentions how you are a fast moving company where the developers bring projects from conception to production. How long do your projects typically take to release an MVP, and then to production? As a solo developer, my timeline has been around 8 months for a good MVP, and then another 4 months for a solid launch.
